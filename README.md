# NBS-Files
This contains 200 NBS files. More to come.
Every song was converted from a MIDI by me, with the exception of Sangue_No_Sand, which is an altered version of Rose Coperte Sangue, made by CR4F70R, and Thermal Runaway, which is from a Diamond Fire game. Feel free to use these songs.
I use these songs with a Figura avatar that can play NBS files, which is why I have so many.
